### Project Directory structure

- **build/**
  - Run `npm run build`, all outputs are put here.
  - This directory is excluded from git repo.(See .gitignore)
- **config/**
  - Env. & Paths variable, development and proudction webpack config are put here
  - If you don't know about webpack, **don't touch this directory!**
- **public/**
  - When you do development & production build, the basic html files are here.
- **scripts/**
  - When you run `npm run start` `npm run build` `npm run test`, those scripts files will be execute. They refer to their own scripts and webpack settings in the config directory.
- **src/**

  - **common/**
  - **components/**
    - All unit of react components are put here. Components directory files made by presentational - container and ducks pattern.
    - Files in this directory are the smallest elements.
    - When you are using react libraries, you will need to wrap some libraries. The files generated by these additional wrapping sources are located in this directory.
  - **pages/**
    - The files putting here are shown to user.
  - **pages/essential**
    - Files in this directory are the elements that you will use commonly when composing a page. The items in the 'component' directory are atomic, The items in this directory are the 'modules'.

- .prettierrc
  - This defines beautify settings. You can use beautify `alt+shift+f` in VsCode. It's very helpful, you should press hotkeys(`alt+shift+f`) after you've written all code.
- tsconfig.json ~ tslint.json

###Source Convention and some tips...

- The directory should consist of lowercase letters and hyphens.

```
(O)pages\search-options\..
(O)components\grid\..
(X)Pages\SearchOptions\..
(X)Components\Grid\..
```

- Use PascalCasing for components file name and components declaration.
- Use camelCasing for variables and function param
- Use uppercase and underscore for constants.

```java
class Counter extends React.Component<{}, { number: number }> {};

const ROW_HEIGHT = 24; // Fixed value that never changes

interface IBoardListProps {
    rows: object[];
    cols: Array<{ key: string; value: string; width: number }>;
    nextPageLoading: boolean;
    loadMoreRows: () => Promise<any>;
    onClickRow?: (info: RowMouseEventHandlerParams) => void;
};
```

- Use lowercase and hyphen and underscore for className(CSS). If you need to distinguish the components within each component, you have to add two underscores. You should separate the CSS properties into different files.

```css
.simple-mui-grid {
  overflow: auto;
  height: 100%;

  .simple-mui-grid__header {
    .simple-mui-grid__cell {
      top: 0;
      position: sticky;
      font-size: medium;
      @include secondary-color;
    }
  }

  .simple-mui-grid__body {
    cursor: pointer;
    .simple-mui-grid__cell {
      & > div {
        max-width: 240px;
        overflow: hidden;
        text-overflow: ellipsis;
        white-space: nowrap;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Think like React. Always think for better way. If the page you are building can be divided into smaller units, devide it. And make it flexible so you can recycle it elsewhere. For example, imagine that you are building a free board. The free board consists of 'grid' and 'search window'. So you have to create a flexible grid and search box that can support either 'free' or 'announcement' or 'information' before create a free board.
- You should be familiar with the View-container pattern. Container does not include any view-related code. Container includes the code associated with the action and user interaction.

```java
(X)
class BoardContainer extends React.Component<IContProps, IContState> {
    ...
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="board_wrap">
                <Dialog
                    maxWidth="md"
                    fullWidth={true}
                    onEscapeKeyDown={this.onCloseBoardForm}
                    onBackdropClick={this.onCloseBoardForm}
                    open={this.state.mode === 'C' ||
                        this.state.mode === 'U' ||
                        this.state.mode === 'R'}
                />
                <BoardForm
                    mode={this.state.mode}
                    boardData={this.state.board}
                    onChangeBoardData={this.onChangeBoardItem}
                    onEditorTextChange={this.onEditorTextChange}
                    onDeleteBoardData={this.onDeleteBoardData}
                    onUpdateBoardData={this.onUpdateBoardData}
                    onChangeUpdatePage={this.onChangeUpdatePage}
                    onCloseBoardForm={this.onCloseBoardForm}
                />
            </div>
        );
    }
    ...
}
(O)
class BoardContainer extends React.Component<IContProps, IContState> {
    ...
    render() {
        return (
            <BoardForm
                // Board form props...
                ...
                // Dialog props...
                ...
            />
        )
    }
    ...
}
```

- You must have a clear understanding of the concept of Immutable.
